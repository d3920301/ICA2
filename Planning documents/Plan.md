## Blueprints

### Player Movement
Player movement should feel quick.

### Player Combat
Player combat should make the player feel strong.

### Dialogue System
The dialogue system is very simple. No branching dialogue.

#### Focused Dialogue
Focused Dialogue doesn't let the Player move.

#### General Dialogue
General Dialogue just shows dialogue above the NPCs head.

### Quest System
A very simple quest system. Just shows current objective on Player HUD. This isn't a new screen. The player cannot choose what quest they want. There will only be one quest at any time.

### Door/Keypad System
Doors have keypads you need to interact with before the door will open.

Some keypads will act as locks, others will just open the door when the player interacts with them.

### Lift System
The lift system is just to take the player up to the second part.

### Inventory System
Just a simple system to show the player what is in their inventory. This isn't a new screen. Just display text to show what the player has at all times.

## Stretch
This was originally part of the project, but I decided to cut it since I didn't think I could make it in the time I had.

#### Week 3
 - [ ] Needs System - Mon 11th Dec 2023

Create a sims like needs system for player character.

 - [ ] Quest System - Wed 13th Dec 2023

Just something on the  screen to show the player their objective.

 - [ ] Dialogue System - Fri 15th Dec 2023

Should be modular, and easily scalable.

### Needs System
The needs system consists of multiple values, relating to various needs, that decrease with time.

These needs are:
 - Hunger
 - Thirst
 - Bladder
 - Medicine/Effects

These needs can affect the player in a negative way if they get too low. The player can increase their current values by using various items they can get around the world.

### Toilet
The toilet can be used to relieve the player from their Bladder stat.

### Sink
It's always a good idea to wash your hands after you've used the toilet!

### Vending Machine
These will vend all kinds of items.

Just food at the moment though.

### Bad effect remover
Removed bad effects (hangover) from player.

### Medicine
Heals player
